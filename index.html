    <p>Hi! I'm a student at UMass Amherst studying computer science and linguistics. My academic interests include topics such as algorithms, human-computer interaction, and phonology. I was previously an undergraduate research assistant at the <a class="link" href="https://blogs.umass.edu/jkingstn/phonetics-laboratory/">UMass Amherst Phonetics Lab</a>. Fluent in English and Russian. My favorite phoneme is ʔ (the glottal stop).</p>
    <p>On the personal side my interests include a wide variety of things such as tennis, travel, and beverages of all sorts. I used to play a lot of video games, but since starting college I have not found much time for this hobby (especially post-pandemic). I listen to most genres of music, some of my favorite being jazz, hip-hop, and rock.</p>
