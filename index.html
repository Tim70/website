    <p>Hi! I'm a master's student at UMass Amherst studying computer science. Previously, I was an undegraduate studying computer science and linguistics. Currently, I am a course grader for CS 611: Advanced Algorithms, the primary graduate-level algorithms course at UMass. My academic interests currently center around algorithms, particularly those with distributed systems or social computing applications. I helped out at the <a class="link" href="https://publicinfrastructure.org/">Initative for Digital Public Infrastructure</a>. I was previously an undergraduate research assistant at the <a class="link" href="https://blogs.umass.edu/jkingstn/phonetics-laboratory/">UMass Amherst Phonetics Lab</a>. </p>
    <p>On the personal side my interests include a wide variety of things such as tennis, travel, and beverages of all sorts (such as <a class="link" id="bev" href=""></a>). Recently, I have become really interested in films (expect a blog post about it soon!). I listen to most genres of music, some of my favorite being jazz, hip-hop, and rock.</p>
